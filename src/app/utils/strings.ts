    "2. A concise explanation of what the new rules are accomplishing" +
    "Keep the explanation short, direct, and free of filler.\n" +
    "Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:\n" +
    "- Default deny; grant only the minimum operations that are clearly implied by the input (code/schema/rules).\n" +
    "- Scope every match to the narrowest possible path; rarely use /{document=**} or overly broad matches.\n" +
    "- Require authentication unless the input explicitly calls for public access.\n" +
    "- Require role-based access control as is necessary to apply the principle of least-privilege.\n" +
    "Keep the explanation short, direct, and free of filler.\n" +
    "Rules requirements:\n" +
    "- Do not use markdown formatting, backticks, or comments in the rules.\n" +
    "- Put each operation (read, write, create, update, delete) on its own line.\n" +
    "- Nest collections and documents correctly; do not combine them in one match line.\n" +
    "- Example: use `match /forums/{forumId}/` then inside `match /posts/{postId}` (never a single combined match).\n" +
    "- Avoid /{document=**} patterns.\n" +
    "- Do not invent collections that are not implied by the user input.\n" +
